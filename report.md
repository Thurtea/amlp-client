# AMLP-Client: Current Files Analysis

Summary
-------

This report identifies which `amlp-client` files appear to be the most up-to-date in the workspace and explains the evidence and next steps to verify.

Findings
--------

- **Most up-to-date source files (current):**
  - `main.cpp`
  - `amlp_manage_connections.cpp`
  - `amlp_manage_connections.h`
  - `CMakeLists.txt`
  - `app.rc`
  - `README.md` and `.gitignore`
  - `mudclient-icons/` (icon assets)

- **Build / backup directories:**
  - `build/` — contains build outputs and project files (Visual Studio/CMake artifacts).
  - `build_backup_from_minimal_mud_client_20260210/` — contains autogenerated files (Qt autogen/moc). The folder name indicates it was created 2026-02-10.

Evidence & reasoning
--------------------

- The top-level `amlp-client` directory contains the full, human-edited C++ source files (`main.cpp`, `amlp_manage_connections.*`) and `CMakeLists.txt` which together represent the source tree.
- The `build_backup_from_minimal_mud_client_20260210` folder only contains Qt autogenerated/moc files (e.g., `mocs_compilation_Release.cpp`, `main.moc`) and no separate source copies, indicating it is a build backup produced on 2026-02-10 rather than a newer source branch.
- `README.md` references screenshots named with timestamps `2026-02-10`, matching the backup date and suggesting active edits around that time.
- No duplicate or newer source files were found inside the backup directory — only generated artifacts — so the canonical sources are the files in `E:\Work\mudclient\amlp-client\`.

Recommendations / next verification steps
---------------------------------------

- To definitively confirm file modification times, run this PowerShell command from the workspace root to list recent file modification times:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path .\amlp-client -Recurse |
  Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending |
  Select-Object FullName, LastWriteTime -First 30
```

- If you use Git, run the following to see the latest commits affecting this folder:

```powershell
git -C .\amlp-client log --oneline --decorate --max-count=20
```

- If you want, I can run the timestamp listing and include the exact modification times in an updated report.

Conclusion
----------

The active, most up-to-date sources for `amlp-client` are the files located at `E:\Work\mudclient\amlp-client\` (listed above). The `build_backup_from_minimal_mud_client_20260210` directory is a build/autogen backup (2026-02-10) and does not contain newer source files.
